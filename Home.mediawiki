Note: Always run the board from 5VDC 1A minimum supply when using a Wifi Dongle. You may need to use a extension cable to move the dongle away from the planes of the PCB.<br />
Sometimes standoffs will work. We also have had instances where when placed in a metal case, there can be Wifi issues as well.<br />
You can also use a dongle with a real antenna on it such as [http:// http://www.logicsupply.com/uwn200/. Logic Supply] which will help<br />

===Serial Debug Cable===

For information on the serial debug cables go to [http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_Serial Serial Debug Cables]<br>

==Board Revisions and Changes==

===Revision C (Production Version)===
This revision increases the eMMC from 2GB to 4GB. We are making this change for several reasons:<br>

1) Complaints from the community about lack of space left in the eMMC.<br>
2) For those worried about their eMMC wearing out, the added space will help in the area of moving the data around to prevent wear out. Assuming of course you don't try and use it all.<br> 
3) Concerns over the long-term availability of the 2GB device. 4GB is currently the low end of the offering. This also gives us two sources.<br>

We are planning a price increase for the Rev C somewhere between $5 and $15. We are working to figure out where it needs to be. This is for several reasons:<br>

1) To cover the increased cost of the 4G devices.<br>
2) Currently there is $0 margin on these boards which limits our ability to bring more manufacturing capacity on line. Added some margin allows us to find more capacity.<br>
3) Without margin, we cannot respond to component price increases due to market forces. This is of particular concern in the area of NAND and DDR3. We have been successful in fighting back some increases, but we don't know if that will continue.<br>

===Revision B ===
This version moves to the AM3358BZCZ100 processor as we are no longer able to get the limited production version of the AM3359AZCZ100. <br>
No changes in features or operation of the board resulted from this change.<br>

===Revision A6A===
No changes in features or operation of the board.<br>

1) Added optional zero ohm resistor to tie GND_OSC1 to system ground.<br>
2) Changed C106 to a 1uF capacitor.<br>
3) Changed C24 to a  2.2uF capacitor. This extends the reset signal to solve an issue where some boards would not boot on power up.<br>
4) Removed R9 and installed R8. This change was based on an alert we just received from TI that there is a power sequencing issue with the TPS65217C power management IC and the power sequencing is incorrect. This change connects the VDDS rail to the VRTC rail. We do not believe at this time, that the issue is causing any issues with the boards, but we want to comply with the directive.

===Revision A6===
No changes in features or operation of the board.<br>

1) Based on notification from TI, in random instances there could be a glitch in the SYS_RESETn signal from the processor where the SYS_RESETn signal was taken high for a momentary amount of time before it was supposed to. To prevent this, the signal was ORed with the PORZn (Power On reset).<br>
2) Noise issues were observed in other designs where the clock oscillator was getting hit due to a suspected issue in ground bounce. A zero ohm resistor was added to connect the OSC_GND to the system ground. <br>
3) Moved the enable for the VDD_3V3B regulator to VDD_3V3A rail. Change was made to reduce the delay between the ramp up of the 3.3V rails. No evidence of this being an issue, but it really needs to be as close to the same as possible.<br>

===Revision A5C===
Production had some fallout of boards when running the HDMI tests in the previous production run. Resistor values were tweaked to improve the test results.<br>
No changes in features or operation of the board.<br>
1) Changed R46,R47,R48 to a 0 ohm.<br> 
2) Changed R45 to a 22 Ohm.<br>

===Revision A5B===
1) Updated the PCB to incorporate the modification that was being done on Rev A5A. There is NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL in functionality between REV A5A and REV A5B.<br>
2) Made the LEDs dimmer for those that could not sleep due to the brightness of the LEDs.<br>

===Revision A5A===
1) Boards are built using the XAM3359AZCZ100 processor.<BR>
2) PCB Change...LCD noise issue was resolved by adding 47pf bypass caps on some of the LCD signals.<BR>
3) PCB Change...Added access to four battery charger signals on the TPS65217 (TS=Temperature Sense, BAT=Battery connection,BATT_SENSE=Battery voltage pin, GND=Ground). Pins are not populated but the four signals are in a 2x2 .1x.1 spacing.<BR>
4) PCB Change...Added a power button which allows for wake up, power down, and sleep options. It also provides the ability to alert the processor before powering down to provide an orderly shutdown. It is expected that SW will be used in conjunction with the switch to control the various power modes and transitions from one to the other. By holding the button down for 8 seconds, it will force a power down of the board.<br>
5) Added a 100K pull down resistor from J1 pin 1 to J1 pin 4 to fix the unterminated serial port issue.

===Revision A4B===
Added a 100K pull down resistor between pins 1 and 4 of J1 to fix the serial port issue.

===Revision A4A===
Incorporated the capacitors to fix the noise issue on the display

===Revision A4===
First prototype release version of the board. Limited distribution. One notable issue here is that the board has an AM3352 processor instead of an AM3359, despite how the part is marked. Part was mismarked as an AM3359. The SGX and PRU are not operational.

==Tips and Pointers==


===Expansion Header Pin Usage===
There are several precautions that need to me taken when working with the expansion headers to prevent damage to the board.<br>

ALL VOLTAGE LEVELS ARE 3.3V MAX. APPLICATION OF 5V TO ANY I/O PIN WILL DAMAGE THE PROCESSOR AND VOID THE WARRANTY.<br>
ANALOG IN VOLTAGES ARE 1.8V MAX. APPLICATION OF >1.8V TO ANY A/D PIN WILL DAMAGE THE PROCESSOR AND VOID THE WARRANTY.<br>

1) Do not apply any voltages to any I/O pins when the board is not powered on.<br>
2) Do not drive any external signals into the I/O pins until after the SYS_RESETn signal is HI (3.3V).<br>
3) Do not apply any voltages that are generated from external sources until SYS_RESETn signal is HI.<br>
4) If voltages are generated from the VDD_5V signal, those supplies must not become active until after the SYS_RESETn signal is HI.<br>
5) If you are applying signals from other boards into the expansion headers, make sure you power the board up after you power up the BeagleBone Black or make the connections after power is applied on both boards.<br>

In the [https://github.com/beagleboard/BeagleBone-Black/blob/master/BBB_SRM.pdf?raw=true System Reference Manual] you will find reference to Boot Pins. These pins are connected to the expansion header.<br>
If you load or terminate these pins to the point it affects their default setting, the board will not boot.<br>

Powering the processor via its I/O pins can cause damage to the processor.<br>
The expansion headers can be viewed on this [[Beagleboard:Cape_Expansion_Headers | Cape Expansion Headers]].<br>

===Serial Header Usage===

Power restrictions on the serial debug header are not an issue. On the board, there is a buffer that prevents damage from occurring by having the connector of the FTDI cable connected to the the header. It is safe to do and will not cause damage to the board when power is not applied to the board.<br>

You can find a list of reported issues and add additional ones by going to [http://bugs.elinux.org/projects/beagleboneblack Bug Tracker]

===Hardware===

Here are the known Hardware issues:

====Wrong Processor REV A4,A4A====
Processor is a AM3352 due to the incorrect part being marked as an AM3359.

====Missing Cables REV A4,A4A====
Does not ship with any cables. Rev A5 will ship with the USB cable.

====Display Noise REV A4====
If you look closely, you will notice some noise in the display. This is due to a termination issue on the board caused by too many connections to the LCD data pins. This will be fixed on the A5 revision.

====Serial Debug CrashREV A4, A4A====
Serial port can cause the system to crash if there is not a serial cable plugged into J1.

====Improper Power Down....All Revisions====
We have been noticing a very small number of boards that are experiencing power issues, where the LED flashes and the board does not power up. We have been chasing this for a while now and due to the small number of boards that have the issue and the fact that the issue can also be caused by having things connected to IO pins not powered correctly, it has been hard to nail down. Our initial take was that it was a manufacturing issue on some boards, but we could never prove that. Based on the latest information we have gathered, this appears to be an instance where the PMIC does not power down the processor in the right order due to the violent removal of the power cables, either USB or DC. So, we are recommending that the power button be used to power off the board or by issuing the Halt command. After that you can remove the power cable. If everyone follows this process, we should see a decrease in these issues, but it will take a while for the results, either good or bad, to show up. This will also help prevent the contamination of the eMMC and the SD cards by allowing the kernel to shutdown properly before power is removed.<br>

Another issue that we have seen is that the power supply when plugged in will create a spike that exceeds the voltage rating of the PMIC or will cause the voltage to drop momentarily. This can occur after power up cycle has started. When this occurs, the PMIC will shutdown. This can cause the processor to be powered down before it is powered all the way up, damaging the processor. It is suggested that to prevent this that you use a well regulated power supply that can handle the current surge of the powering up process.

==BeagleBone Capes==

BeagleBone capes are add on boards that can be connected to the BeagleBone Black to add functionality. These capes are made by a lot of different companies and individuals.<br> 
A list of capes that are in production are listed at [https://beagleboard.org/cape BeagleBone Capes].<br> 

If you have a cape that is in production and can be purchased and you would like it listed, please contact [mailto:jkridner@beagleboard.org Jason Kridner] or the [mailto:beagleboard@googlegroups.com BeagleBoard Google Group mailing list]. More information regarding the Cape Expansion Headers can be found at [http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:Cape_Expansion_Headers Cape Expansion Headers].

Most of the current capes will work with the BeagleBone Black at some point. However, the kernel is 3.8 on the BeagleBone Black, so work is required to get the drivers updated for most of the capes to work.<br>
Some may not work or may require some hardware changes due to some differences in the design of the BeagleBone Black as described below.<br>

For a list of the ones that are currently identified as compatible and incompatible, go to [http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBone_Black_Capes BeagleBone Black Capes].<br>

===Onboard HDMI===
The onboard HDMI driver uses the LCD pins. They are still connected to the expansion header, but in some cases, they could cause an LCD cape to have some noise issues unless the cape has a buffer.<br>
A buffer should take care of this issue. If you want to use these pins as GPIO pins, you may be limited in speed due to the capacitance caused by the loading of the pins by the HDMI driver.<br>
They should function fine in most applications.<br>

===Onboard eMMC===
The onboard eMMC uses the MMC1 signals. They are also connected to the expansion header.<br>
The expectation is that in order to use these signals, the eMMC device on the BeagleBone Black will need to be disabled by activating the reset line to the eMMC device.<br>
It is not clear that this will work as you have to write to the eMMC first and tell it to enable the reset. 
At this point in time, it is not totally clear that the reset line will do the trick. Further investigation is ongoing. This will also require booting from the uSD port.<br>
Best option is to not use the MMC1_CLK and MMC1_CMD signals at all and tie them low.<BR>
Do not use these signals for anything else will trying to use the other eMMC1 lines on the expansion header.<BR>

===10Pin Connector===     
The 10 pin power expansion header has been removed. Any cape needing this connector will not be 100% compatible.

==RMA Support==

If you feel the board is defective and you want to get it looked at go to [http://beagleboard.org/support/RMA RMA Request]
You will need the serial number. It is located on the expansion header in the form of a white label.<br>

 We only accept RMA requests for those boards purchased through authorized BeagleBoard.org
 distributors.<br>
 You can find  a list of authorized distributors on the buy pages at BeagleBoard.org <br>
 
 If you purchase a board from an unauthorized distributor, you need to return the board to them for
 replacement or repair.<br>
 Shipping to the repair depot is covered by the requester. Return shipping is paid by the repair
 depot.<br>
